NAME
    Time::Timestamp - Perl extension the easy manipulation of timestamps
    (subclass of datetime)

SYNOPSIS
      use Time::Timestamp;
      my $t = Time::Timestamp->new(ts => time) or Time::Timestamp->new(ts => $strTime); (see HTTP::Date::str2time for list of stringtypes)
      print $t->tsIso()."\n";
      print $->eepoch()."\n";
      $t->set_time_zone('est');

DESCRIPTION
    This takes the best of DateTime / HTTP::Date and mixes them together.
    HTTP::Date has some great date parsing capability, so we use that to
    translate most any time format and store it as a DateTime obj.
    Everything is calculated and stored as eepoch, so local timezone won't
    be an issue util you need to translate.

OBJECT ORIENTED METHODS
  set_time_zone
      This cleans up the DateTime::set_time_zone. It gets fussy if you don't send it in uppercase.

  tsIso
      This returns the ts in ISO format 'yyyy-dd-mm 00:00:00'

PROCEDURAL METHODS
  normalize
      returns the eepoch version of your string (interface to HTTP::Date::str2time)
      my $t = Time::Timetamp::normalize($strTime,$TZ);

SEE ALSO
      DateTime
      HTTP::Date
